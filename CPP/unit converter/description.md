### **Unit Converter**

**Unit Converter** is a simple yet elegant C++ program that transforms numbers from one unit to another — meters to kilometers, grams to kilograms, liters to milliliters — and back again.

Just tell it **“How much? From what? To what?”** — and it gives you a clear, precise answer without drama.

> To remind you that even the simplest tool can save time — whether you’re solving homework, double-checking lab units, or debugging an engineer’s calculation.

**Key features:**

* Supports basic units of length, mass, and volume (`m`, `cm`, `km`, `g`, `kg`, `l`, `ml`).
* Runs straight from the command line:

  ```bash
  converter.exe 150 cm m  ➜  1.50 m
  ```
* No extra dependencies — just pure C++.
* Validates your input and protects you from silly mistakes.
