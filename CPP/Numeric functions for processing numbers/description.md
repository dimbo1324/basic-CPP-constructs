**Numeric functions for processing numbers**

It showcases key algorithms from `<numeric>` (and friends) so you can see how just a few lines turn a vector of ints into a powerhouse:

1. **std::accumulate**: Sum up every element—gather those data rays into one bright beam.
2. **std::inner\_product**: Compute the dot product of two vectors—check how “in sync” they really are.
3. **std::partial\_sum**: Build a running total to watch your array’s “reaction potential” grow step by step.
4. **std::adjacent\_difference**: Take differences between neighbors—reading each evolutionary leap in the data.
5. **std::iota**: Fill a vector with ascending values—simple, yet poetically satisfying.
6. **std::reduce** (C++17): A turbocharged accumulate, primed for parallel futures.
7. **std::transform\_reduce** (C++17): Combine transform and fold in one shot—because two birds with one STL arrow is just good design.

Each block stands alone as its own mini-experiment. Run it, watch the console output, and feel the functional-programming vibes orchestrate a numerical symphony.
